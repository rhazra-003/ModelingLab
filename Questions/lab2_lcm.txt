a company has 4 wh and 6 stores. 
wh alltogether have a surplus of 22 units of a given commodity.
individual surplus at wh 1, 2, 3 and 4 are 5, 6, 2 and 9 units resp.
the 6 storages all together needs 22 units of the commodity.
individual requirements of the stores 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 are 4, 4, 6, 2, 4, 2 resp.
cost of shipping of 1 unit of commodity from wh i to store j is given in the matrix below.

	s1 s2 s3 s4 s5 s6
w1	9  12  9  6  9  10  5
w2	7  3   7  7  5  5   6
w3	6  5   9  11 8  11  2
w4	6  8  11  2  2  10  9

	4  4   6   2  4  2


1. formulate the mathemetical model for the problem.
2. how should be the products be shipped from the wh to the storage so that the transportation prooblem is minumum.
